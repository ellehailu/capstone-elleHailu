    - Users can see how well everyone in the league is doing from the leaderboard feature

    - Backend: maybe c#  
	- Frontend: maybe typescript, javascript, react

    - Themed UI
    - Include multiple different shows within the franchise

- What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
